# Donut Tycoon

In this assessment, you'll build a RESTful, database-driven, HTTP server.

## Plot

Congratulations! Your name was found in the will of a deceased donut tycoon.  Apparently she had no next of kin, and your name was the first result on google when she searched 'booyah'. Naturally, she placed YOU as the heir to all of her donut shops before she passed. Now the fate of 'dozens' of donut shops lies in your capable coding hands. You must create an app that will allow you to manage your donut shops and keep track of employees. Donut let us down!

**Time:** One Day

**Success Criteria:**
 - Build CRUD apps in Express
 - Access data using an ORM / Knex
 - Design and implement schemas
 - Access data in datastores through joins
 - Design and implement a RESTful API

**Bonus:**
 - Write tests in a TDD style using Mocha Chai

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project directory
1. Set up Express
1. Bonus: set up tests

## Overview

Your app consists of three resources: shops, employees, and donuts.

### Business Rules

- Shops have many donuts, many donuts belong to many shops
- Shops have many employees, employee belongs to a shop
- Employee has one favorite donut
